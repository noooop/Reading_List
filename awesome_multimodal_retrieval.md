- Thu, 30 May 2024 [Jina CLIP: Your CLIP Model Is Also Your Text Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20204)
  - txt: BERT with AliBi(jina-embeddings-v2), img: EVA02 ViT B/16 (224*224) 
  - Our experiments show that EVA02 significantly outperforms comparable image encoders like DinoV2 (Oquab et al., 2024) and ViT B/16 models from OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021)
  - Training Recipe (three-stage training) 
    - Stage 1 focuses on learning to align image and text representations while minimizing losses in text-text performance. To this end, we train on large-scale and weakly
supervised text-image and text-text pair datasets.
    - Stage 2 presents longer, synthetic image captions to
the model while continuing to train with text-text pairs.
    - Stage 3 uses hard negatives to further improve the text
encoder in separating relevant from irrelevant text. To
maintain text-image alignment, we continue training
on long image captions.

  - Built on Qwen2-VL
  - Finding
    - Generating embeddings with bidirectional attention and mean pooling outperforms the common approach of using compression prompts with the last token mechanism.
    - Masking instruction tokens during mean pooling enhances embedding performance.
    - Progressive transition effectively adapts decorder-only MLLMs to embedding models through stepwise training.
    - Increasing batch size yields performance gains, but these improvements plateau without appropriate learning rate scaling. Additionally, learnable temperature parameters play a pivotal role in enhancing the effectiveness of contrastive learning.
    - Hard negatives may hinder convergence during training. Filtering false negatives and mixing random in-batch negatives help balance difficulty and improve performance.
    - Distillation from the Reranker model using just 10% of the data achieves a notable performance boost, providing an efficient approach that can streamline the recall-then-rerank cascade structure by removing the rankers.
  - U-MARVEL Framework
    - (1) Progressive transition: the model is progressively fine-tuned on the increasing complexity levels of the retrieval data, which enables the model to gradually adapt to retrieval tasks. 
    - (2) Hard Negative Mining: building on Progressive transition, the model’s retrieval performance is further enhanced through hard negative mining, accompanied by the filtering of false negatives. 
    - (3) Distillation: we perform knowledge distillation on the reranker model using the sampled dataset sequentially.
